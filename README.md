Welcome to the **Vehicle Tracking with Machine Learning and Computer Vision** project! This open-source project aims to provide an easy-to-use solution for tracking vehicles in videos. Whether you're analyzing traffic patterns, conducting research, or just curious about what's on the road, this project has you covered.

## Features

- **Upload Any Video:** Users can upload videos of their choice for vehicle tracking.
- **Vehicle Tracking:** Our state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision algorithms will track vehicles in the video.
- **Output Video:** The program generates an output video with tracked vehicles highlighted, providing a visual representation of the tracking results.
- **Configurable Options:** Fine-tune tracking parameters to match your specific use case.

## How it Works

1. **Upload Video:** Users upload a video to the application.
2. **Tracking:** The program processes the video frame by frame, detecting and tracking vehicles using advanced computer vision techniques.
3. **Output Video:** A new video is generated with tracked vehicles highlighted for easy visualization.

## Getting Started
